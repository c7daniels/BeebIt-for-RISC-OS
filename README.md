BeebIt - BBC Micro Computer Emulator for RISC OS

BeebIt is a freeware BBC Micro computer emulator for RISC OS versions 3.00 and above.
It emulates the Acorn BBC Model B, BBC Model B+ and BBC Master range of computers.
BeebIt will now run on all RISC OS computers from RiscPC to the Raspberry Pi.

Norcroft 'C' and ARM Assembler are needed to rebuild using the accompanying Makefile, although the code will also build with GCC with a new Makefile and minimum modifications.

BeebIt will not work as it stands. You will need a copy of the OS and BASIC ROM images that came with the original BBC Computer.
Pace Micro Technology Limited still hold the copyright over these ROMs and therefore they cannot be distributed with this emulator.

Please read the !Help file for more information.
